This sketch contains the code for sending the infrared code received by Smart Phone to the corresponding infrared receiver
I have modify the sketch in order to include the IRremote library.
I would like to thank Michael Margolis who created the prototype sketch for the UDP Send String and also the Ken Shirriff for the IRSend demo sketch.
